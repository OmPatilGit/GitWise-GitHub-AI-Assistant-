GitWise AI 🧠✨
Your intelligent command-line partner for seamless Git & GitHub workflows.

GitWise is a terminal-based AI agent that understands natural language, allowing you to manage complex Git operations, enforce best practices, and resolve common frustrations like merge conflicts with ease. Stop memorizing commands and start having a conversation with your repository.

🌟 Key Features
🗣️ Natural Language Commands: Interact with Git and GitHub using plain English. No more git --flags-you-forgot.

🤖 Smart Commits & PRs: Automatically generates professional, conventional commit messages and pull request summaries by analyzing your code changes.

🤝 AI-Powered Merge Conflict Resolver: Transforms the most dreaded part of Git into a guided, understandable process. The AI analyzes conflicts, explains the developers' intent, and proposes a resolution for your approval.

📄 Instant Summaries: Get quick, high-level summaries of pull requests to speed up code reviews and understand your team's work faster.

🛡️ Safe & Interactive: The agent always shows you the command it's about to run and asks for confirmation on critical operations, ensuring you're always in control.

🧩 Extensible Toolset: Built on a modular architecture, allowing for new Git and GitHub commands to be added easily.

🚀 Installation
Get up and running with GitWise in a few simple steps.

Prerequisites:

Python 3.9+

Git installed on your system.

GitHub CLI installed and authenticated (gh auth login).

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/gitwise-ai.git
cd gitwise-ai

Set Up a Virtual Environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure API Keys:
Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY='your-secret-key-here'

💡 Usage
Launch the interactive terminal session to start talking to your agent.

python main.py

Now you can manage your repository with natural language:

You: What's the status of my repo?

Agent: You have 2 modified files. I'm about to run 'git status'.

You: Add everything and do a smart commit.

Agent: Okay. I've analyzed your changes. The suggested commit message is: 'feat: implement user authentication endpoint'. Shall I proceed? (y/n)

You: A merge conflict just happened. Help me fix it.

Agent: I've analyzed the conflict in 'api/routes.py'. It seems one developer added a new parameter while the other refactored the function name. Here is my proposed resolution...

🛠️ How It Works
GitWise is built on a powerful, modern AI stack:

LangChain & LangGraph: The core of the agent is a state machine built with LangGraph. This allows for complex, multi-step reasoning. The agent can call tools, analyze the output, and decide on the next best action in a continuous loop.

Tool-Based Architecture: Every Git or GitHub command is a "tool" that the agent can choose to use. This makes the system highly modular and easy to extend with new capabilities.

LLM-Powered Reasoning: A Large Language Model (like GPT-4) acts as the "brain," interpreting user requests, selecting the right tools, and generating human-readable summaries and code resolutions.

The flow is a simple but powerful "Think → Act → Observe" loop, managed entirely by the graph.

🗺️ Project Roadmap
This is just the beginning. Here's what's planned for the future:

[ ] Phase 2: Full GitHub Integration

[ ] Create and manage PRs directly from the agent.

[ ] List, view, and comment on issues.

[ ] Phase 3: Enhanced User Experience

[ ] Integrate the rich library for beautiful terminal outputs (colors, spinners, tables).

[ ] Implement a full Text User Interface (TUI) with textual.

[ ] Phase 4: Advanced Git Operations

[ ] AI-assisted interactive rebase (git rebase -i).

[ ] "Git archaeology" tool to find when a specific line of code was introduced (git blame on steroids).
