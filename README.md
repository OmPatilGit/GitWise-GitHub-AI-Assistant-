# Working and Undertakes:

## GitWise is built on a powerful, modern AI stack:

LangChain & LangGraph: The core of the agent is a state machine built with LangGraph. This allows for complex, multi-step reasoning. The agent can call tools, analyze the output, and decide on the next best action in a continuous loop.

Tool-Based Architecture: Every Git or GitHub command is a "tool" that the agent can choose to use. This makes the system highly modular and easy to extend with new capabilities.

LLM-Powered Reasoning: A Large Language Model (like **GPT-OSS-20B**) acts as the "brain," interpreting user requests, selecting the right tools, and generating human-readable summaries and code resolutions.

The flow is a simple but powerful "Think â†’ Act â†’ Observe" loop, managed entirely by the graph.


## Future Takes
- Project Roadmap
This is just the beginning. Here's what's planned for the future:

- Phase 2: Full GitHub Integration. Create and manage PRs directly from the agent.List, view, and comment on issues.

- Phase 3: Enhanced User Experience. Integrate the rich library for beautiful terminal outputs (colors, spinners, tables).Implement a full Text User Interface (TUI) with textual.

- Phase 4: Advanced Git Operations. AI-assisted interactive rebase (git rebase -i).`"Git archaeology"` tool to find when a specific line of code was introduced (git blame on steroids).
